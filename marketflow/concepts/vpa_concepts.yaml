effort_vs_result: |
  Effort vs. Result is a core concept in VPA that compares the volume (effort)
  with the price movement (result).
  
  Key principles:
  1. High effort (volume) with small result (price movement) indicates potential reversal
  2. Low effort with large result indicates weakness in the move
  3. Equal effort and result indicates a healthy trend
  
  Examples:
  - High volume up day with small price gain: supply is meeting demand (bearish)
  - Low volume down day with large price drop: no support present (bearish)
  - High volume down day with small price drop: demand is meeting supply (bullish)

vpa_overview: |
  Volume Price Analysis (VPA) is a trading methodology that analyzes the relationship 
  between price action and volume to reveal market sentiment and identify trading opportunities.
  
  VPA is based on the work of iconic traders like Charles Dow, Jesse Livermore, and Richard Wyckoff,
  and focuses on how volume confirms or contradicts price movements. The core principle is that
  volume precedes price, meaning significant volume changes often signal upcoming price movements.
  
  Key concepts in VPA include:
  1. Volume confirms price - When price and volume move in the same direction, it validates the move
  2. Volume contradicts price - When price and volume move in opposite directions, it signals potential reversal
  3. Effort vs. Result - Comparing the effort (volume) with the result (price movement)

accumulation: |
  Accumulation in VPA refers to a pattern where large operators or institutions are buying
  an asset while trying to keep the price relatively stable to avoid driving it up before
  they complete their buying.
  
  Key characteristics of accumulation:
  1. Sideways price movement with narrowing range
  2. High volume on down days but price doesn't fall much (absorption)
  3. Low volume on up days
  4. Tests of support that hold with decreasing volume
  
  Accumulation typically occurs after a downtrend and precedes an uptrend.

distribution: |
  Distribution in VPA refers to a pattern where large operators or institutions are selling
  an asset while trying to keep the price relatively stable to avoid driving it down before
  they complete their selling.
  
  Key characteristics of distribution:
  1. Sideways price movement with narrowing range
  2. High volume on up days but price doesn't rise much (supply)
  3. Low volume on down days
  4. Tests of resistance that fail with decreasing volume
  
  Distribution typically occurs after an uptrend and precedes a downtrend.

buying_climax: |
  A buying climax in VPA is a pattern that marks the end of an uptrend, characterized by:
  
  1. Extremely high volume (often the highest in the trend)
  2. Wide range up candle
  3. Price at or near the high of the trend
  4. Often followed by a reversal or significant pullback
  
  A buying climax represents the last surge of buying before smart money begins to distribute.
  It often shows exhaustion of buying pressure and is a bearish signal.

selling_climax: |
  A selling climax in VPA is a pattern that marks the end of a downtrend, characterized by:
  
  1. Extremely high volume (often the highest in the trend)
  2. Wide range down candle
  3. Price at or near the low of the trend
  4. Often followed by a reversal or significant bounce
  
  A selling climax represents the last surge of selling before smart money begins to accumulate.
  It often shows exhaustion of selling pressure and is a bullish signal.

testing: |
  Testing in VPA refers to price probes of support or resistance levels with specific
  volume characteristics that reveal the strength of these levels.
  
  Key characteristics of testing:
  1. Support test: Price moves below a previous low but with lower volume
  2. Resistance test: Price moves above a previous high but with lower volume
  
  The outcome of these tests provides valuable information:
  - If support holds on low volume, it's strong support
  - If resistance breaks on high volume, it's a valid breakout
  - If resistance fails on low volume, it's a false breakout
