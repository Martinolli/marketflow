We have learned what underlies each event; how it is formed,\nhow it is represented on the chart, the psychology behind it and so on. But\nas I say, the method is much richer.\nI say this because, by the very nature of the market, it is practically\nimpossible for any two structures to be completely the same. While it is\ntrue that on a daily basis we see \"textbook\" schemes, which are very\ngenuinely adapted to classic examples, on most occasions the market will\ndevelop less conventional structures, where the identification of such\nevents will be more complex.\nIt is therefore essential not to focus on the exact search for events",

You may not\nidentify the Climax, the Reaction and the Test in a genuine way, but the\nobjective is that the market has stopped and has initiated a change of\ncharacter (migration from trend to sideways).\nAs we can see in the examples, although these structures do not\nlook anything like the classic structures already studied, if we open the\ngraph and we find ourselves at the point marked with the arrow, it is not\nunreasonable to think that possibly a process of accumulation has\ndeveloped below.

VOLUME\n \nIn our way of conceiving market analysis, we initially do not value the\npossibility of not taking into account either of these two data points, price\nand volume. But as you delve deeper into the ecosystem that surrounds\nthe financial world, some obstacles start to arise.\nWithout beating around the bush, I have to say that in my view\nprice data is certainly more relevant than volume data. And I will now\nreason this assertion on the basis of two elements.\nOn the one hand, the intraday volume that we can analyze in any\nasset can be very misleading depending on the time of the session. For\nexample, at the opening of the American session of the S&P500 in its\nlocal time (ETH), we will always see a large volume, much higher than\nthat seen prior to that opening during the regular time (RTH). And of\ncourse, all the previous analysis will be biased in a certain way.",

It would not make much sense to make analysis taking into account\nglobally all price action and volume as it could lead to confusion.\nIt is not that during regular trading hours we have identified a\nmovement with a lack of interest (low volume); it is that this low volume\nis due to an absence of traders at that time. The same would be true for\nother times during the session, such as at the mid-day stop or just before\nthe start of the final stretch of the day, when there is also a significant\nincrease in volume.\nOnce we know this, we have two ways to deal with this situation:\n❖ If we want to continue trading on intraday time frames\nwe must necessarily analyze the price and volume in comparative\nterms; on the one hand the one observed during local hours and",

We could be analyzing an asset at any time\nand the price action would be faithfully reflected without having to be\naware of the time of the session and perform comparative analysis. This is\nthe advantage of price.\nAlthough without volume we lose a large part of the available\ninformation, the continuous interaction between supply and demand\nleaves its traces in the price and it develops some certainly repetitive\npatterns (not in form but in substance).\nObviously I am not recommending trading without analyzing\nvolume data, it is not necessary; I simply wanted to highlight the\nprevalence of price over volume for our way of understanding and trading\nthe markets.",

It is a battle between these\nlarge capitals and therefore there will be part of them that will generate a\nloss in some of their trading.\nThe key to determine that we are in front of a failed structure is that\nit has absolutely all the traces in favor of one direction but at the decisive\nmoment (in the test after the break); it fails and generates an imbalance in\nfavor of the opposite side.\nAs for the example of failed accumulation, we would have to see",

    "text": "this principle of failed reversal.\nIn case of considering a purchase, there is an interesting detail to\ntake into account. As the entry trigger is below the weekly VWAP, it\ncould be a good option to make such a trade with a lower leverage, for\nexample, in a CFD market. This is a perfect example to evaluate the\npossibility of trading the same asset in different markets depending on the\nconfidence we have in the trade in question. If we find ourselves in a\nsituation like this in which we observe such elements against the proposed\nscenario, the most advisable thing to do would be advisable not to trade in\na leveraged market such as the futures market; and on the contrary, to go\nto a market that offers a less leveraged type of trading such as CFDs.",

    "text": "Going further into this concept of working with different brokers\nand markets, it is important to remember that you do not necessarily have\nto pigeonhole yourself into any particular type of trading. You may want\nto carry out shorter-term speculative trading of the asset in question on the\nfutures market; and this is not incompatible with proposing scenarios that\ncover a longer time horizon and carry out such medium-term trades using\nthe CFDs already mentioned; and also to be able to carry out longer-term\ntrading with spot shares or exchange-traded funds (ETFs), for example.\nThis is one of the benefits of the methodology, its universality. Its\nreading, being based on the true engine of the market, the continuous\ninteraction between buyers and sellers, is equally valid regardless of the\nasset and seasonality; with the only basic requirement being that the\nparticular asset has sufficient liquidity.",
