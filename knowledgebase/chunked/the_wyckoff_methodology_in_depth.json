At first glance they seem to be random movements, but\nthis is not the case at all. The price is shifted up and down by fluctuations.\nWaves have a fractal nature and interrelate with each other; lower\ngrade waves are part of intermediate grade waves, and these in turn are part\nof higher grade waves.\nEach uptrend and downtrend is made up of numerous minor uptrend\nand downtrend waves. When one wave ends, another wave starts in the\nopposite direction. By studying and comparing the relationship between\nwaves; their duration, speed and range, we will be able to determine the\nnature of the trend.",

These can be bullish if they go up or bearish if they go\ndown.\n▶ Trading ranges. They can be of accumulation if they are at the\nbeginning of the cycle, or of distribution if they are in the high part of the\ncycle.\nAs we have already seen, the displacement of the price during these\nPhases is done by means of waves.\nDuring the accumulation phase, professional traders buy all the stock\navailable for sale on the market. When they are assured by various\nmanoeuvres that there is no longer any floating bid, they begin the upward\ntrend phase. This trend Phase is about the path of least resistance.\nProfessionals have already verified that they will not encounter too much\nresistance (supply) that would prevent the price from reaching higher levels.\nThis concept is very important because until they prove that the road is free",

Large traders need to find other\ntraders with whom they can place orders when opening and closing trades\n(counterparty). That is why they take advantage of the Shake movements to\nopen positions, and keep them until they reach certain levels where they will\nagain find enough liquidity to close those positions.\nThe key is that these trading areas act as price magnets because they\ngenerate enough interest to make different traders want to place their pending\norders on them (attracting liquidity). And this liquidity is what makes the\nprice tend to come to them.\nFor example, large traders who have bought heavily on a bearish\nmove (Spring), will need to keep the position open at least until they find\nanother major liquidity zone that allows them to close those purchases.

In this example\nwe already see how that upward slope suggested certain strength.\nAfter the stop of the downward movement, we see a reduction of the\nvolume during Phase B and a genuine Spring + test as Phase C. Classic\ndevelopment of the accumulation schematics.\nOnce the range is broken, the price manages to stay above it and\ncreates a minor structure of reaccumulation with a shock that reaches the\nbroken area, depending on the BUEC of the major structure. Very visual how\nthe volume suggests a certain harmony at all times, being observed in\nincrease on the impulsive movements and in decrease on the corrective ones.\nAlready during Phase E the market generates a new structure of\nreaccumulation with a new shakeout that serves to continue the price rise.",
