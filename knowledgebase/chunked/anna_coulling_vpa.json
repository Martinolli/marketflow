Think again. This was the approach used by the iconic traders of the past, such as\nCharles Dow, Jesse Livermore, and Richard Wyckoff. These traders built huge fortunes using this technique, using nothing more than the ticker\ntape, pencil and paper.

In these dark days before the internet I could only rely on newspapers, and it was in January 1998 that I read an article in the\nSunday Times about a trader who had made significant sums from trading, and was now looking for recruits to train in his methods. That trader’s\nname was Albert Labos.\n \nTwo weeks later, on an early Sunday morning, I joined hundreds of other hopefuls in a packed room, on the HMS President.

These were trading techniques\nwhich could take on the cartel, currently enjoyed by these market makers.\n \nWe were then introduced to a Tom Williams. We were told that Tom was partially sighted, and I can’t quite remember if he had a white cane. We\nwere also told that Tom was an ex ‘syndicate trader’. However, to this day I am not entirely certain what a ‘syndicate trader’ is or does. But at the\ntime it sounded very impressive.

Once learnt you will be able to apply this methodology to any time frame and to every instrument.\n \nFinally, the best way to answer the third question of whether Volume Price Analysis can be applied to all trading and investing strategies, is with a\nquotation from Richard Wyckoff who, as you will find out shortly, is the founding father of Volume Price Analysis. He wrote the following in his book\n'Studies in Tape Reading'\n \n“In judging the market by its own actions, it is unimportant whether you are endeavnd u are eouring to forecast the next small half hourly swing,\nor the trend for the next two or three weeks. The same indications as to price, volume, activity, support, and pressure are exhibited in the\npreparation for both. The same elements will be found in a drop of water as in the ocean, and vice versa”",

Regardless of whether you are scalping as a speculator in stocks, bonds, currencies and equities, or you are trend,\nswing, or position trader in these markets, or even investing for the longer term, the techniques you will discover here are as valid today as they\nwere almost 100 years ago. The only proviso is that we have price and volume on the same chart.\n \nFor this powerful technique we have to thank the great traders of the last century, who laid the foundations of what we call technical analysis today.\nIconic names such as Charles Dow, founder of the Dow Jones, Dow Theory and the Wall Street Journal, and generally referred to as the\ngrandfather of technical analysis.\n \nOne of Dow's principle beliefs was that volume confirmed trends in price.

If the\nprice continued moving in one direction, and with associated supporting volume, then this was the signal of the start of a trend.\n \nFrom this basic principle, Charles Dow then extended and developed this idea to the three principle stages of a trend. He defined the first stage of\na bullish trend as, ‘the accumulation phase’, the starting point for any trend higher. He called the second stage ‘the public participation phase’ which\ncould be considered the technical trend following stage. This was usually the longest of the three phases. Finally, he identified the third stage, which\nhe called ‘the distribution phase’. This would typically see investors rushing into the market, terrified that they were missing out on a golden\nopportunity.",

One of the many reasons for this was his view of the market and market behaviour.

When demand is greater than supply, then prices will rise to meet this demand, and\nconversely when supply is greater then demand then prices will fall, with the over supply being absorbed as a result.\n \nConsider the winter sales! Prices fall and the buyers come in to absorb over supply.\n \n2.The Law of Cause and Effect\n The second law states that in order to have an effect, you must first have a cause, and furthermore, the effect will be in direct proportion to the",

If the cause is small, then\nthe effect will also be small.\n \nThe simplest analogy here is of a wave at sea. A large wave hitting a vessel will see the ship roll violently, whereas a small wave would have little or\nno effect.\n \n3.The Law of Effort vs Result\n This is Wyckoff's third law which is similar to Newton's third law of physics. Every action must have an equal and opposite reaction. In other words,\nthe price action on the chart must reflect the volume action below. The two should always be in harmony with one another, with the effort ( which is\nthe volume ) seen as the result ( which is the consequent price action ).

It\ncan then be applied to any instrument in any market in any time frame. The reason software does not work with VPA, is simply that most of the\nanalysis is subjective.

The\nrepeated buying by the insiders is highlighted in blue.\n \nI have deliberately avoided using a scale on the chart, either in terms of price or time, as I believe it is the 'shape' of the price and associated\nvolume bars which is important. This is the price action which creates the classic price congestion which we see in all time frames, and which is\nwhy this ‘shape’ is so powerful, when associated with volume. This is what gives price action, the three dimensional perspective using VPA.\n \nOnce the campaign has begun, the price action then follows this typical pattern, where the market is repeatedly moved higher and lower.

In other\nwords, a market can only trend higher, trend lower or move sideways in a consolidating phase of price action.

Whilst these levels do constitute barriers and platforms, they\nare not solid walls, and on occasion you will see them broken, only for the market to then move back into the channel once again.

If the cause is large, then this will be reflected in the effect, which applies to\nsupport and resistance. The longer a market consolidates in a narrow range, then the more dramatic the resulting price action once the market\nmoves away from this region. Naturally this is all relative, not least because a market that has been consolidating on a daily chart for several weeks\nis likely to trend for a similar period, whilst any breakout from a consolidation phase on a 5 minute chart may only be for an hour or so – it is all\nrelative.\n \nThird Principle\n The third principle is perhaps the one which perplexes most new traders and it is this – how do I know when the market is in congestion?

His core beliefs in this aspect of price behaviour were founded\non one simple principle which was this – that the trend in an index, was far more revealing and valuable than the trend in an individual stock. His\nview was very simple. An individual stock could be influenced by any number of factors, from earnings reports, broker recommendations, and\nanalysts views, all of which would affect the price.

One of his many axioms, that have since been absorbed into modern day\ntechnical analysis, is the concept of systematic and unsystematic market risks.\n \nSystematic risks affect all stocks in an index, whilst unsystematic risks may affect only one or a group of stocks in one particular market. Dow's own\nwork centred around the creation of indices, which now form the cornerstones of the financial markets, with the S&P 500, the Dow Jones (DJIA),\nthe Nasdaq (NQ100) and many more around the world. In addition, the concept of an index has been adopted by virtually every other market and\ninstrument and led to the creation of volatility indices, such as the VIX, sector indices for stocks, currency indices such as the Dollar Index (DXY)",

Now in his world, of course, the ticker tape was still the main source of data, and for Charles Dow and the\nother iconic traders of his day and later, the time frames were very different to those of today.

The markets have changed beyond all recognition. High frequency trading, market manipulation and the move to\nelectronic trading have all seen to that.\n \nNevertheless, Dow's original and pioneering work gives us a hook on which to hang our hat.

    "text": "Nevertheless, the point is this. These visual regions created using the VAP approach, give us vital clues and signals which help us in many different\nways. They help to validate the current price action. They reveal the 'depth' of support and resistance in key congestion areas, and they give us\nconfidence on breakouts, when the platform of support or resistance is there for us to see. If it is strong, then we have additional confidence to take\na position, if it is weak, we may hold back and wait for other signals. Finally VAP reveals the strength of support and resistance for future price\naction, which again helps us to visualise and analyse risk.\n \nNow in the next chapter we are going to examine some further examples using Volume Price Analysis (VPA). However I would urge you to discover\nmore about VAP for yourself. The examples I have used here have all been using stocks, but it is a technique that applies equally well to many other\nmarkets and instruments.",

As the name suggests, a falling triangle pattern is a sign of weakness. We can see\nimmediately from the volume, that we are in a congestion phase, but in this case the mark kcasattet is also moving lower. Each attempt to rally is\nseen as a series of lower highs, and is a clear signal of weakness. If this market is going to break anywhere, there is a strong chance that it will be\nto the downside, since each attempt to rally is becoming weaker and weaker in terms of the high of the candles. The floor of the congestion area is\nvery well defined, and any sustained break below here will be signalled with volume.\n \nAs with all price patterns, the falling triangle appears in all time frames and on all charts, and we must always remember Wyckoff's rule of cause",

The concept is one in which volume is considered to be more important than time, and as such the X axis of the chart is\nreplaced with volume, whilst the Y axis remains as before with price. The principle idea is that in adopting this approach in presenting the price and\nvolume relationship on the chart, this emphasizes the relationship, with volume moving to the chart itself, where it joins price, rather than as an\nisolated indicator at the bottom of the chart. As a result, and with the change in the X axis from time, to volume, the ‘time’ element is removed and\nthe focus is then solely on the volume price relationship.\n \nThis relationship is then presented in the form of ‘boxes’. The vertical element of the box, in other words the height, is simply the high and low of the\nsession in terms of price. The horizontal element is volume, which of course varies, as to whether this is ultra high, high, medium or low, which in",

In\nother words, orders that are sell orders and those that are buy orders, with the net difference between the two then displayed as ‘delta’. For\nexample, if the software calculates on one bar, that there have been 500 contracts sold at the bid and only 200 contracts bought at the ask, then this\nwould represent a net difference of 300 contracts sold. Any indicator measuring delta volume would then display this as a negative volume bar of -\n300 and generally these appear as shown in the schematic below in Fig 12.12",
