WyckoƯ \nRichard Demille WyckoƯ (1873–1934) was an early 20th-century pioneer in the technical \napproach to studying the stock market. He is considered one of the ﬁve “titans” of \ntechnical analysis, along with Dow, Gann, Elliott, and Merrill. At age 15, he worked as a \nstock runner for a New York brokerage. Afterward, while still in his 20s, he became the \nhead of his ﬁrm. He also founded and, for nearly two decades, wrote and edited The \nMagazine of Wall Street, which, at one point, had more than 200,000 subscribers. \nWyckoƯ was an avid student of the markets, as well as an active tape reader and trader. \nHe observed the market activities and campaigns of the legendary stock operators of his",

From his observations and interviews \nwith those big-time traders, WyckoƯ codiﬁed the best practices of Livermore and others \ninto laws, principles, and techniques of trading methodology, money management, and \nmental discipline. \n \nMr. WyckoƯ observed numerous retail investors being repeatedly ﬂeeced. Consequently, \nhe dedicated himself to instructing the public about “the real rules of the game” as played \nby the large interests, or “smart money.” In the 1930s, he founded a school that would \nlater become the Stock Market Institute. The school's central oƯering was a course that \nintegrated the concepts that WyckoƯ had learned about identifying large operators' \naccumulation and distribution of stock with how to take positions in harmony with these \nbig players. His time-tested insights are as valid today as they were when ﬁrst articulated.",
