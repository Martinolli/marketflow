Based on his theories, studies and real-life experiences, WyckoƯ \ndeveloped a trading methodology that has stood the test of time. WyckoƯ started with a \nbroad market assessment and then drilled down to ﬁnd stocks with the most proﬁt \npotential. This article, the ﬁrst of two, details WyckoƯ's approach to broad market \nanalysis. It is important to understand the broad market trend and the position within this \ntrend before selecting individual stocks. \n \nAbout \n \nRichard D. WyckoƯ \nRichard WyckoƯ began his Wall Street career in 1888 as a runner, scurrying back and forth \nbetween ﬁrms carrying documents. As with Jesse Livermore in the bucket shops, WyckoƯ \nlearned to trade by watching the action ﬁrsthand. His ﬁrst trade occurred in 1897, when \nhe bought one share of St. Louis & San Francisco common stock. After successfully",

After successfully \ntrading his own account several years, he opened a brokerage house and started \npublishing research in 1909. The Magazine of Wall Street was one of the ﬁrst, and most \nsuccessful, newsletters of the time. As an active trader and analyst in the early 1900s, his \ncareer coincided with other Wall Street greats including Jesse Livermore, Charles Dow \nand JP Morgan. Many have called this the “golden age of technical analysis.” As his stature \ngrew, WyckoƯ published two books on his methodology: Studies in Tape Reading (1910) \nand How I Trade and Invest in Stocks and Bonds (1924). In 1931, WyckoƯ published a \ncorrespondence course detailing the methodology he developed over his illustrious \ncareer. \n \n \nWyckoƯ",

Moreover, this \ninformation was usually already factored into the price by the time it became available to \nthe average speculator. Before looking at the details, there are two rules to keep in mind. \nThese rules come directly from the book Charting the Stock Market: The WyckoƯ Method \nby Jack K. Hutson, David H. Weiss and Craig F. Schroeder. \n \nRule One: Don't expect the market to behave exactly the same way twice. The market is \nan artist, not a computer. It has a repertoire of basic behavior patterns that it subtly \nmodiﬁes, combines and springs unexpectedly on its audience. A trading market is an \nentity with a mind of its own. \n \nRule Two: Today's market behavior is signiﬁcant only when it's compared to what the \nmarket did yesterday, last week, last month or even last year.

Nothing in the stock market is deﬁnitive. After all, stock prices are driven by \nhuman emotions. We cannot expect the exact same patterns to repeat over time. There \nwill, however, be similar patterns or behaviors that astute chartists can proﬁt from. \nChartists should keep the following guidelines in mind and apply their own judgments to \ndevelop a trading strategy. \n \nBroad Market Trend \nBy deﬁnition, the vast majority of stocks move in harmony with the broader market. \nChartists, therefore, should ﬁrst understand the direction and position of the broad \nmarket trend.

These include the S&P 500, \nthe S&P 100, the Nasdaq, the NY Composite and the Russell 2000. \n \nWyckoƯ used the daily high, low and close to create a series of price bars and construct \na classic bar chart. The objective was to determine the underlying trend for the broader \nmarket and identify the position within this trend. Trend is important because it tells us \nthe path of least resistance for the majority of stocks. Position is important because it \ntells us the current location within this trend. For example, trend position helps chartists \ndetermine if the market is overbought or oversold to time buy and sell decisions.",
